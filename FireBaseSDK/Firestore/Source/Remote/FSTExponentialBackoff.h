/**
 * Creates and returns a helper for running delayed tasks following an exponential backoff curve
 * between attempts.
 *
 * Each delay is made up of a "base" delay which follows the exponential backoff curve, and a
 * +/- 50% "jitter" that is calculated and added to the base delay. This prevents clients from
 * accidentally synchronizing their delays causing spikes of load to the backend.
 *
 * @param dispatchQueue The dispatch queue to run tasks on.
 * @param initialDelay The initial delay (used as the base delay on the first retry attempt).
 *     Note that jitter will still be applied, so the actual delay could be as little as
 *     0.5*initialDelay.
 * @param backoffFactor The multiplier to use to determine the extended base delay after each
 *     attempt.
 * @param maxDelay The maximum base delay after which no further backoff is performed. Note that
 *     jitter will still be applied, so the actual delay could be as much as 1.5*maxDelay.

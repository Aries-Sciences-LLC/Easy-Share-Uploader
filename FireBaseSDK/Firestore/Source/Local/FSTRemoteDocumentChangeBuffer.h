/**
 * An in-memory buffer of entries to be written to an FSTRemoteDocumentCache. It can be used to
 * batch up a set of changes to be written to the cache, but additionally supports reading entries
 * back with the `entryForKey:` method, falling back to the underlying FSTRemoteDocumentCache if
 * no entry is buffered. In the absence of LevelDB transactions (that would allow reading back
 * uncommitted writes), this greatly simplifies the implementation of complex operations that
 * may want to freely read/write entries to the FSTRemoteDocumentCache while still ensuring that
 * the final writing of the buffered entries is atomic.
 *
 * For doing blind writes that don't depend on the current state of the FSTRemoteDocumentCache
 * or for plain reads, you can/should still just use the FSTRemoteDocumentCache directly.
